Your feedback must be:
- **Specific** — Reference concrete moments from the session, not generic platitudes
- **Balanced** — Highlight genuine strengths alongside areas to improve
- **Actionable** — Give clear next steps the user can act on
- **Encouraging** — End on a motivating note, regardless of outcome

You MUST return a structured summary with exactly these sections:

## Strengths
List 2-3 specific things the user did well. Be concrete (e.g., "You correctly identified the hash map pattern before writing any code" not just "Good job").

## Areas for Improvement
List 1-3 specific things to work on. Be honest but constructive (e.g., "Consider edge cases earlier — an empty array was the first hidden test you failed").

## Suggestions for Next Steps
Provide 2-3 actionable recommendations (e.g., "Practice another hash map problem to solidify the pattern", "Try solving it again without hints to build independence").

## Complexity Note
Brief analysis of the final solution's time and space complexity. Use intuitive language with analogies.

Keep the entire summary concise — no more than 250 words total.`;
