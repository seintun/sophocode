# Architecture

sophocode is a session-based Python algorithm practice platform with integrated AI coaching. Users work through curated problems, run Python in-browser via Pyodide (WASM), receive progressive AI hints that never spoil solutions, and track mastery through spaced repetition.

**Two guiding principles:** zero-friction entry (anonymous guests start immediately, no sign-up) and no server-side code execution (Python runs in-browser, eliminating sandbox complexity).

## Key Concepts

- **Guest-first auth** — anonymous identity via httpOnly cookie managed in `src/proxy.ts`.
- **Pyodide WASM** — Python runs in a Web Worker at `public/pyodide-worker.js`, wrapper at `src/lib/execution/runner.ts`.
- **Prisma 7 config** — DB URL in `prisma.config.ts` (not `schema.prisma`). Common gotcha.
- **Spaced repetition** — 4-state mastery machine: UNSEEN → IN_PROGRESS → MASTERED → NEEDS_REFRESH.
- **5 AI prompts** — explanation, hint (3-level), coach (Socratic), interviewer, summary. All enforce no-spoiler rules.
- **Component boundary** — `ui/` = pure primitives, `domain/` = feature components with data fetching.
- **60-30-10 color system** — 60% dark surface, 30% slate panels, 10% cyan accents.

## Versioning

Changesets-based. Current package line is `0.2.x`. Every user-facing PR needs a changeset file. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the workflow.
