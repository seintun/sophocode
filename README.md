# sophocode

AI-coached coding interview practice. Learn patterns, not just problems.

**[sophoco.de](https://sophoco.de)** · [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) · [Contributing](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)

> **Beta** (`0.2.x`) — APIs and data models may still evolve between commits. We are preparing for a `v0.3.0` release soon.

## What It Is

sophocode is a session-based Python algorithm practice platform with an AI coach that teaches through Socratic questioning — never giving away solutions. Users practice curated DSA problems, get progressive hints, and build mastery through spaced repetition.

**Three session modes:**

- **Self-Practice** — hints off or delayed, work at your own pace
- **Coach Me** — AI coach available on demand, guiding with questions
- **Mock Interview** — simulated interview with probing follow-ups

**Core loop:** Clarify → Plan → Code → Reflect

---

## Features

- **Zero-friction entry** — start practicing immediately, no sign-up required. Guest data migrates to your account when you're ready.
- **In-browser Python** — code runs via Pyodide (WebAssembly), no server sandbox needed. Instant feedback, works offline after first load.
- **Progressive hints** — 3 levels (direction → approach → specific) that never spoil the solution.
- **Pattern-based learning** — master the platform's DSA pattern taxonomy (core + advanced), not memorize 1000 problems.
- **Spaced repetition** — problems resurface based on mastery state and review intervals.
- **AI coaching** — five specialized prompt contexts (explanation, hint, coach, interviewer, summary) powered by OpenRouter.
- **Mastery heatmap** — visualize your pattern coverage on the dashboard.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Prerequisites: Bun ≥ 1.1.0, Node ≥ 20

git clone <repo-url>
cd sophocode
bun install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_DEFAULT_KEY,
#          DATABASE_URL, DIRECT_URL, OPENROUTER_API_KEY

# Database — apply migrations, then seed sample problems
bunx prisma migrate dev
bunx prisma db seed

# Run
bun dev
```
