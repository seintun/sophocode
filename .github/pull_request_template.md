## Changeset

<!-- REQUIRED for any user-facing or API change. Run `bun run changeset` and commit the generated file.

<!-- Reason for skipping (if applicable): -->

## Architecture / Flow Diagram (Mermaid, if helpful)

<!-- If needed, add a Mermaid diagram. Omit this section if no diagram improves clarity. -->
<!-- Mermaid reliability rules (GitHub):
- Use quoted labels: A["label text"].
- Avoid shape shorthand with special chars in labels (do NOT use A[/api/path], A[(text)], etc.).
- Avoid raw `/`, `()`, `[]`, `|` inside unquoted labels.
- If render fails, keep diagram in fenced code block and link a follow-up fix.
-->
<!-- Safe example:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
  UI["Settings / Onboarding / Coach"] --> STATUS["/api/account/status"]

STATUS --> PROFILE["user_profiles"]
